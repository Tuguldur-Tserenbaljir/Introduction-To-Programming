				How I wrote the program 
	Before writing the program, I wanted to break my program into little parts so that it can be done easier. 
Knowing the bingo game is only won if and if only the selected numbers add up to the same number as the bingo matrix. 
For example, in a 5X5 bingo is won if the corresponding diagonals, rows or columns are selected in which they make a 
line of 5 selected numbers, in my case the amount of selected numbers adds up to 5.
         Firstly, I created an array which stores the bingo numbers with a n number of rows and columns that are inputted
 from the user. Then I created a while loop which gets the guessing numbers of users for the bingo game until -1 is met. 
Continuing on I used another array to store data for the purpose of passing 1s and 0s if the guessed numbers are guessed right.
 For later use, adding 1s and 0s seemed much easier for me to check for bingo on the later stages.
               Secondly, I wanted to check if there was actually a bingo in the given data. 
Created an algorithm to check if the right or left diagonal, rows and columns would add up to the matrix of the bingo.
 Passing on the bingo numbers as 2 to make life easier to print asterisks in front of them but before printing out the asterisks and the output, 
I had to check if the user had won and print it out.
               Thirdly, for the last step was to print out the output with single or double asterisks and spaces depending on the value.
 For example, If the bingo number was passed on as 2 it would print asterisks, single or two depending on the digits of the number.
               In bringing up the rear, I learned how to plan it at a time which I had help from free source from the internet and the teaching assistant Brandon.
 Thanks to them, I was able to finish.
